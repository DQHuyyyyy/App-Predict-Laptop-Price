# Use Selenium to crawling data from website Amazon.
1.Why I used Selenium to Crawling Data, not used BeautifulSoup:
- Selenium: Can interact with and manipulate web pages (e.g., clicking buttons, filling out forms).
- BeautifulSoup: Cannot interact with web pages; it only parses static HTML.
2. I did 2 steps of collecting data from Amazon:
- Step 1: Collect links of Laptop products.
- Step 2: From those links, I use the command to manually access each link in turn so I can get Laptop information (Brand, Operating, Screen Size,..)
- After collecting, I will save it in CSV file format.
